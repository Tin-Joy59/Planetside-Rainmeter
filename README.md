The alert countdown updates in real time. Every update cycle, the conuter syncs with the remaining time from the API.

####Customizable refresh rate (Default: 60s)
Please, keep in mind that there are 2 requests to the APIs on every update cycle. Setting a higher refresh rate **DOES NOT** help with the performance of the widget. My advice is to keep it between 1 and 5 minutes.
